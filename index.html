                    Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share the planet with a friend. Everyone needs a planet and a friend. Planets are the most valuable things in the galaxy. Give him a planet, we forget that we have our BOGO planet sale going on.

                        <p>
                            These little son of a gun planets hide in your galaxy and you just have to push them out. This is the time to get out all your frustrations, much better than buying a Millennium Falcon. At least you get a marginal return on investment when you buy our planets.
